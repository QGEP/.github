## Welcome to the TEKSI wastewater Module GitHub Home page ðŸ‘‹
TEKSI wastewater module (project name: QGEP) is a selection of tools and a database implementation that allows you to:

* manage and map your sewer network data with all its components in compliance with Swiss standards
* indicate the characteristics of networks objects in the form of attributes such as diameter, material, depth, damages, construction year, etc.
* produce plans and extract statistics from the database such as network values, total length of pipes, identification of future interventions, etc.
* export geodata in compliance with Swiss standards


TEKSI wastewater module is a complete open source module based on a PostgreSQL - PostGIS data model compatible with the swiss norm SIA405 AND VSA DSS. The data are accessed and edited with a dedicated QGIS project.
The project is maintained by the [TEKSI community](https://www.teksi.ch)
